All notebooks/code associated with Levine et al., 2020. This repository is the public spin off the saildrone components from a larger private repository, thus file and development history is limited. All files here were used to produce data/figures for final publication.

Due to the size of the acoustic data set, Echoview processing files, and HYCOM data, only intermediate data products are included. Raw acoustic data will be accessible via NCEI at a later date and information will be updated in this repository. HYCOM + NCODA metadata are provided for those interested in accessing the data directly via the [HYCOM Data Server](https://www.hycom.org/data/glbu0pt08/expt-91pt2). Data still in preparation for other reporting and publication such as net catch data will be made available at a later date.
